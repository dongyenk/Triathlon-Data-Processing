__**INTRODUCTION**__
----------------------
  This repository contains programs, that receive data input, process the data, then output useful data to the user. Some of the files will be based on work I did in Univerisity classes,
  but I have improved the code, and done some experimentation.

__**FILE NAMES**__
---------------------
File names will begin with 2 numbers.
E.g. "01_data_processing.ino", will have the oldest code I typed, and just be an improved version of a program I made in a class. End, "17_data_processing.ino", will be a more recent program, that I did in my own time.

__**FILE TYPES**__
----------------------
.ino files are programs made in the Arduino IDE, that require the IDE, and an Arduino, to compile.

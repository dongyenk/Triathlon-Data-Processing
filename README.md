The C++ folder contains a recent work in progress remake version, of the old triathlon data processing program.
Went back to it recently (02/12/2021) after C++ self study.

A similar program was made in university, for the Arduino computer. The C++ folder contains a much more recent version, made in C++, that is improved, and uses my self study.

Code is written and tested in the CodeBlocks IDE

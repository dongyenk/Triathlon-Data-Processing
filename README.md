__**INTRODUCTION**__
----------------------
  This repository contains programs, that receive data input, process the data, then output useful data to the user. Some of the files will be based on work I did in Univerisity classes,
  but I have improved the code, and done some experimentation.

__**FILE NAMES**__
---------------------
File names will begin with 2 numbers.
E.g. "01_data_processing.ino", will have the oldest code I typed, and just be an improved version of a program I made in a class. And, "17_data_processing.ino", will be a more recent program, that I did in my own time, that uses more of my self study knowledge.

If there's a header (.h) file, with a name beginning with the same 2 numbers as a source file(.ino, .cpp), that source file needs the header file!!.
		E.g. "02_data_processing.ino" must be in same directory as "02_my_functions.h"


__**FILE TYPES**__
----------------------
.ino files are programs made in the Arduino IDE, that require the IDE, and an Arduino, to compile. The Arduino IDE serial monitor can't handle input, unless "no line ending" is selected.

__**COMMENTS AT THE TOP OF SOURCE FILES**__
-------------------------------
At the top of the source files, will be comments, explaining what that program does.

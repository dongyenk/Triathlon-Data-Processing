# Some Information

A similar triathlon data processing program was made in university, for the Arduino computer.

The C++ folder contains a much more recent version, made in C++, that is improved, and uses my self study.

Code is written and tested in the CodeBlocks IDE. Compiling the multiple files was a bit unintuitive. I had to create an empty project, then add my 3 files, before being able to compile.

# 05/12/2021 Update.
• The C++ folder contains 2 versions, of a functionally identical program.

• triathlon_data_processing_WITH_VALIDATION.cpp -> The single file version.

• The multiple_files_version folder contains the version made up of 2 source files and 1 header file, that only contains function declarations. (From my self study)
